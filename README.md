# ⚡️Lightning

Lightning is the second generation of my home electricity supply monitoring system.
It's still running on my Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, but it's based on Cloudflare Tunnel and a simple internal Golang ping service.

The system is intended to be pinged from outside by UptimeRobot.

Deployed by Ansible playbook.
